# sm64ex-coop-Brazilian-Portuguese-Dub
This ex-coop mod gives the playable characters a brazilian portuguese voice.

Mario's VA: PietroM
Luigi and Waluigi's VA: VectorLua
Toad's VA: Gui
Wario's VA: Garlicker



Be in mind this mod was in production before Golbe's, 
but it is part of his mod too.
Our dub is the native quality one, based on N64 to the Wii era. 
Our dub is also based on 'The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!',
hence some of the catchphrases coming from the Brazilian dub of said show.


Golbe's dub covers an HQ version, with phrases and voices based
off the newer games, Wii U to Switch days.
More info on his version, will be available on his
mod release. Our mod is going to be hosted here on GitHub for archiving
purposes!


-Yours Truly,

PietroM (a.k.a, Pietro Maciel Rodrigues)
